#### How to create an application to control Music.app using AppleScript.

Swift code to manage "Music.app" using AppleScript.

# Capability and privacy setting

At first, you have to add the following privacy authentication phrase to the `Info.plist`.

## Permit the application to use AppleEvent.

## Permit to communicate with Music.app.

# ScriptBridge

## Create Music.h using `sdef`

```
sdef /System/Applications/Music.app | sdp -fh --basename Music
```

## Import header file

Added Music.h to the Xcode project.

## Create Bridging Header

At first, create a dummy objective-c sources and then Xcode will ask you to create a bridging header.

You can add the following line to the bridging header.

```objc
//
//  Use this file to import your target's public headers that you would like to expose to Swift.
//

#import "Music.h"
```

## Prepare interface to write Swift code

You have to prepare the interface to write Swift code.
But, I've already implemented [the python script](https://github.com/sonsongithub/AppleScriptBridge/blob/main/converter.py) to extract the Swift interface from the header file.

```bash
python converter.py ./AppleScriptBridge/Music.h ./AppleScriptBridge/Music.swift
```

## Write Swift code

```swift
if let musicApp: MusicApplication = SBApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.Music") {
    if let song = musicApp.currentTrack {
        print(song.name)
        print(song.artist)
    }
}
```

## Shortcomming

Using ScriptingBridge for Music.app has some limitations.
For example, we can't select the current playlist among the playlists.
Such limitations can be overcome by using AppleScript.

### NSAppleScript

We can also use `NSAppleScript` to execute AppleScript.
This way requres us to write AppleScript codes and implement some classes or structs to handle the result. Refer to [the example](https://github.com/sonsongithub/AppleScriptBridge/blob/main/AppleScriptBridge/AppleScriptManager.swift).

MusicConMenu uses this class to select the current playlist.
Please refer to [the source code](https://github.com/sonsongithub/MusicConMenu/blob/105eef145c286ea40d1b4d8c247251b35ada39a1/MusicConMenu/Music%2Bextension.swift#L68)

```
extension MusicPlaylist {
    func play() {
        do {
            guard let name = self.name else { return }
            let script = """
            tell application "Music"
                play the playlist named "\(name)"
            end tell
            """
            _ = try AppleScriptManager.call(script: script)
        } catch {
            print(error)
        }
    }
}
```
